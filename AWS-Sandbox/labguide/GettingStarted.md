## Remaining Lab duration

Please keep an eye on the lab timer displayed on the right side of the header -  it shows the remaining time for your lab environment. Once the lab duration ends, the environment and all associated credentials and resources will be automatically deleted.
 
If you’re unable to complete your lab or testing within the allotted time and need an extension, please contact our support team at cloudlabs-support@spektrasystems.com before the environment is deleted.

### **Exploring Your Lab Resources and Credentials**

Here, you can find all necessary information such as your **AWS login link, username, password**, and any other environment-specific details required to start your lab.

### **Utilizing the Split Window Feature**

For convenience, you can open the lab guide in a separate window by selecting the **Split Window** button located at the **top-right corner** of your screen.

**Note:**
Some options may not be visible depending on your current screen resolution. In such cases, use the **Split Window** feature to open the lab guide in a separate tab or window and maximize the view of your virtual machine.
You can enable this by clicking the **“+” (plus)** button in the top-right corner of the lab interface.

### **Managing Your Virtual Machine**

You have full control over your virtual machine (VM) during the lab.
From the **Resources** tab, you can **start**, **stop**, or **restart** your VM as needed to suit your testing and learning workflow.
