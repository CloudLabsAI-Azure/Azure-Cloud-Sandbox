## Azure Credits

You have been given Azure credit limit of $20 USD which includes the running cost of resources deployed while running through the sandbox.

## Alerts

- You will receive cost alerts via your registered email address when specific thresholds of your 
allocated Azure Credit are reached: at **50%, 75%, 90%, 95%, and 100%** utilization.

- These alerts serve as proactive notifications to keep you informed about your Azure spending and ensure you are aware of your consumption levels.

## Cost Monitoring

To monitor and analyse your Azure credit spend, you can navigate to the Azure Subscription page by following the steps mentioned below:

1. From Azure portal home page, search for **Subscriptions (1)** using the search bar and select the same from the suggestions.

1. Select **Cost analysis** tab from the **Cost Management** pane. You can access a comprehensive breakdown of your Azure spending, offering a granular view of costs associated with various services, and resources.

## Duration of the Sandbox:

- The sandbox environment will be active for **10 days/240 hours** from the time of registration.

- The maximum allowed virtual machine uptime is only hours. It is recommended to deallocate the virtual machine while not in use.

## VM Idle Start/Stop:

The virtual machine is set up with a custom feature called Idle start/stop. This custom package will check the virtual machine's idleness every 2 hours/120 minutes. If the virtual machine is left idle for over 2 hours, a pop-up window will appear, prompting you to respond. If you do not act within 15 minutes, the virtual machine will shut down automatically.This feature is enabled for virtual machines to optimize Azure costs.

## Deletion of the Sandbox

When 100% of Azure credits are spent, the sandbox environment will get automatically deleted without any prior notification. To retain the environment for a longer period and to get the most out of the environment, please follow the best practices mentioned below.

## Best Practices

1. **Resources usage:** Please stop the virtual machines and other resources when not in use to minimize the Azure spend.

1. **Alert notifications:** Make sure to check your registered email's inbox for any alert-related mails. Alerts give you can head start to keep your Azure spending in control and to plan out the remaining credits in the best way possible.
